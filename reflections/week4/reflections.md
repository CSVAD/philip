# Week 4 Reading Reflections

### Closed Systems

The first section, void(), cogently articulates the very human processes involved in creating generative art pieces: pushing limits, encountering errors and crashes, and knowing when to see "error" cases as desirable and thus be able to integrate those cases into the design.

> Generative art requires that the artist
be able to express herself through the manipulation of these systems, choosing computational strategies
and appropriate parameters in a combination of technical skill and aesthetic intuition.

I'm very curious to see what the definition of "these systems" may come to mean in the next 10 years. Will they be code-based or GUI, will they be mobile or desktop?

> early computer art pioneers like Charles Csuri, Manfred Mohr, Vera
Molnar or Frieder Nake

Note to self: explore these artists' works.

> This move beyond projections and the screen as mediating surfaces is one of the more exciting recent
developments in computational systems.

YES! BEYOND THE PIXEL!

> Meanwhile, artists are experimenting with “data sculptures”, representing normally intangible information flows as physical manifestations.

This connects with my Vox Augmento project: the idea of sound objects that can be acted upon in a VR space.

> While generative art is inextricably linked to the computer as a means of production, the work is not
about the computer itself.

It is easy for me to forget that the work is not about the computer. One of the reasons why I am studying at UCSB is to develop my artistic practice alongside my technical dexterity.

### Playing a Game of GANstruction by Helena Sarin

My take-away from Helena Sarin's talk was that she is extremely curious, and her curiosity has charted this adventurous creative journey.

When she described developing a "small GAN" practice, where the training and processing can be done at home on consumer gear, it helped to reframe GAN technology for me as a tool for individual artists, something that is approachable for the individual rather than technology that is exclusive to the halls of large corps and academia.

> I'm sorry, I don't care about debates. [...] If you call yourself an artist, and your work art, then that is it. If someone disagrees, that is their problem.

Absolutely bingo.


### Machine Learning Art: An Interview With Memo Akten

> How can I create computational systems, now using deep learning, that give people meaningful control and enable them to feel like they are able to creatively and even emotionally express themselves?

This is a life-long quest kind of question. It resonates with me and my quest for such a quest ;-)

>  I mean I just like using them as a mirror to ourselves. We can only understand the world through the lens of everything that we’ve seen or heard or read before. We are constantly trying to make sense of everything that we experience based on our past experiences. We see things not as they are, but as we are.

This makes me think of how sample-based music triggers memories upon listening. Because our memories construct our understanding of self, sampled-based musics can be very powerful because our understanding of self resonates to the composer's selections.



### Che-Wei Wang (CW&T) on The new role of the designer in generative design

I was shaken and stirred by Che-Wei's story of using performance-based generative design tools to design a bike stem. It inspired me to think of the design tools that could be built to assist music producers.

Che-Wei's point that we have to keep the whole system in mind-- that the data _can_ and _will_ be wrong and can make or break a design struck me as a very important possibility to keep in mind when working with data sets small and large. His story was about snowboard helmets, but I think about recent incidents where facial recognition softwares were shown to have racial bias or simply not be able to identify certain faces.
