## Stop Drawing Dead Fish

> When we create the behavior visually, we are thinking geometrically. When we create the behavior in code, we are thinking algebraically.

> If we are going to interact with maths to create dynamic pictures or living art, we should use the maths that interacts with our visual system-- geometry. [Paraphrased]

I've never thought about this difference. Since visual tools have, in my experience, provided less flexibility and control-- I have usually discounted them. Perhaps this is because visual art/design has never been my primary discipline... and because I like the flexibility that programming gives me.

I appreciate the way that Bret Victor's tools make it possible to author complex behaviors using direct manipulation. The smoothing behavior is challenging for me to fluently program-- it doesn't feel obvious. I've written it several times, and am always a bit surprised when it works. In Bret Victor's tool, he is able to express this concept very easily, and it makes sense because it is being authored in a visual, geometry-oriented tool.

> What computers truly excel at: simulation

I have to think about sound an music tools, because as we discussed, direct manipulation with audio is not really possible-- you don't directly manipulate the vibrations in the air.

I reflect on what processes are challenging in audio tools or environments... and YES, sampling and sample manipulation are strange because
* dragging a mouse
* to move a pointer on a screen
* to a box to click
* a button...

has nothing to do with listening. So the challenge in audio/music processes is to _get to listening_ as soon as possible (note: _getting to listening_ is also letting the computer do what it does best, simulation [of vibrations in air]). Manipulation of tactile interfaces, such as Ableton Push or NI Maschine, help producers explore with their hands and their ears quickly with less keyboard/mouse distraction in between.

## Dynamic Pictures

> With a dynamic picture today, appropriation is a nightmare. The picture is described by pages of code. You have to read through all the code, figure out what each part is doing, figure out how to disentangle the code you want from its surroundings without breaking dependencies, and figure out how to incorporate this foreign code into yours, which might be using different conventions, libraries, or even languages.

This is a really interesting and challenging problem, because of the standards required to solve it, but I absolutely agree!

> It's fashionable to rationalize this helplessness with talk of "complementary skillsets" and other such bullshit. But the truth is: An author can write a book. A musician can compose a song, an animator can compose a short, a painter can compose a painting. But most dynamic artists cannot realize their own creations, and this breaks my heart.

I'm curious what the data says about this in 2019. I think as a credit to Bret Victor and others in the field, the situation in 2019 is looking much nicer. To this reader, it seems design systems are being developed at an impressive rate these days.
