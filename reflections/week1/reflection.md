## Week 1 reflection

"One might argue that the ultimate symbolic systems great software could eventually just
do all the work. But this is not the case, for there will always be intentions that we
cannot or choose not to express in symbols. Specifically, there are limits to the domain
of formalized code. In all likelihood, a human-computer partnership will continue to
surpass either the unaided human or the autonomous algorithm for some (important)
aspects of work. Neither decidable formal manipulations alone, nor traditional craft
unleveraged by symbolic systems, should be able to keep pace with a partnership
between inarticulable insight, or impetus, and rigorous symbolic reasoning. So long as
this is the case, personal practice will prosper primarily in its coupling to digital
notational systems, and digital notational systems will be useful just as much as they
encourage human imagination."

This quote resonates with my understanding of how technology is a lever for humans, not a replacement. I specifically like the usage of the word "intention" with regard to the crucial nature of human operators, no matter what level of abstraction they may operate at. A generative music expert working to create systems that spit out background music for ads on youtube videos is still constructing, via her intentions, the domain of possibilities that music might fall in.

I think of my research role in terms of the final sentence -- digital notational systems will be useful just as much as they encourage human imagination.
