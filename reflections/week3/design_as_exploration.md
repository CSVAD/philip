# Design as Exploration

The subject of interface design resonates with me as I have built plenty of interfaces in my former career as a full-stack software engineer.

I find that the system proposed for coding multiple alternatives for user interface to be compelling, but it seems to introduce a significant weight of switching costs when alternating one's headspace to different environments. While this is an integral part of designing for multiple contexts, the interface designer part of me is not convinced that this approach is the best fit.
