# 10 PRINT reflection

> He goes on to speculate that the viewer examines patterns by trying to anticipate what comes next. “Delight,” he writes,
“lies somewhere between boredom and confusion”

My experience as a musician and an experiential designer resonate with this idea. Listening to new music is a dance of satisfactin for the ears-- it is satisfying to hear the composition proceed as you expect it, and it is satisfying when the composer loses you by changing directions. This satifactions work best when they are balanced.

When showing my interactive installations for the first time, I was stuck by how most people approach an unknown installation as a puzzle: a problem that must be solved. Once they have achieved the "aha" moment, the experience changes. They have moved from a state of confusion to a state of informed exploration. Hopefully they remain there for a spell. Often times the "aha" moment is the end of the line-- indicating that and there is no space between boredom and confusion for that person.

PRINT, LeWitt’s drawing allows for horizontal and vertical lines, to create
four choices for each grid element. LeWitt’s work is encoded as an algorithm—another similarity with 10 PRINT. A difference is that the instructions are in English, rather than BASIC:

Interesting point of collaboration: LeWitt designed the system of design and rules for implementing the design, and invited the onsite worker to choose the direction of the lines. This strikes me as an interesting human + computational system collaboration as the designer is interacting with the worker via the computational system.
