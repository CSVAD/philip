# Reflections

Using the plotter introduced a number of challenges relating to the software representation of my artwork and how that differed from what I assumed was there. Firstly, I had an issue even getting my PDFs to open in InkScape. After troubleshooting for some hours, I realized that my PDF files were very large... and that they contained a lot more data thathan I would have thought. The issue was that my Processing code was laying down multiple copies of lines, so that the data in the PDF was 4-8 times more than I expected. This caused InkScape to freeze up.

After I addressed this, and actually got to plotting, the AxiDraw seemed to still be drawing lines multiple times-- which meant that the piece I wanted to create would require 60 minutes of plotting time. Because of this, I had to save my design as a PNG, then trace it to vectors in InkScape. While this allowed my design to be plotted, there were certain features of the design that were lost due to the way that the bitmap was converted to vectors.

While my final output was a line-based piece, one of my tests was a point-based piece. I tested it with a marker that had a long brush-like tip. When the plotter made the points, the marker/brush created interesting textures on the paper. I was very inspired by this unexpected output, and would like to book more time with the plotter to explore the creation of point-based plotter pieces with different kinds of pens, markers, and paintbrushes.

I accidentally bumped the table several times, and while this did not affect the plotting in a noticable way, I would like to explore introducing jitter and noise to the plotting process via external disturbance of the plotter or paper.
