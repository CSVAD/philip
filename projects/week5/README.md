# Week 5: Create a Drawing Tool

## Philip's Twig Brush

My twig brush was inspired by some of the "fur" type brushes that we saw
in class, as well as Jennifer's PatternBrush. My twig brush is designed
to emulate the look of someone dipping twigs in ink. It also has
characteristics of fur, in that lines are being painted as a function of
speed.

The main difference between the twig brush and tools we have in the real
world: the twig brush will never run out of ink, and it integrates pen
speed and light randomness to create its unique lines.
