# Peach Blossom Sketch

To run PBS, you'll need the DrawingFramesManager library installed into
your processing libraries.

Simply copy the folder DrawingFramesManager into your
Processing/Libraries folder. You will need to restart processing if it
is open.

Now you can open Peach Blossom Sketch.

Be sure to check out the `Animation` sketch inside DrawingFramesManager
library. It will give you the tools you need to create your own system
to create multiple frames and output them to PDF suitable for creating
an animation flipbook, either using the plotter or simply printing the
PDFs.
