# Final Project Proposal

## Option 1: new computational tool: Peach Blossom Sketch

Peach Blossom Sketch is a fun animation tool for creating doodles that
come to life!

As a youngster, I was fond of creating animated stick-figure GIFS using Microsoft paint as my main drawing tool. My plan is to return to this practice both for myself and in collaboration with an illustrator/painter who is interested in animation.

## Features

* Quickly doodle some noodles, flip to the next frame and see the previous sketch as a semi-transparent reference layer (onion-skin).
* Create distinct animated objects with different numbers of animation frames.
* Use the webcam to bring in an image to draw over.
* Apply vertex filters to bring additional movement to your doodles.

## Implementation challenges

* creating and storing animation frames

* how to integrate ipad tablet for drawing

* vector-based frame representation to facilitate interesting filter effects

## Design challenges
* create a lightweight UI that is simple, straightforward, while still supporting the needs of the animator

* The concept of parametric filter effects for vector data is somewhat abstract. Presenting these parametric filters to the user will be challenging

## Strategies for evaluation

* I want to facilitate an "aha" moment for users that don't have an animation practice. If newcomers to animation have a hard time getting started, then that is a orange flag.

* Another goal for the project is for users such as myself and my collaborator to create more substantial works, supported by features such as undo/redo, saving/loading
