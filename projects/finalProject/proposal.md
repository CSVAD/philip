# Final Project Proposal

## Option 1: new computational tool: Peach Blossom Sketch

Peach Blossom Sketch is a fun animation tool for creating doodles that
come to life!

* Quickly doodle some noodles, flip to the next frame and see the
previous sketch as a semi-transparent reference layer.
* Create animated objecs with different numbers of animation frames.
* Use the webcam to bring in an image to draw over.
* Apply vertex filters to bring additional movement to your doodles.
