# Final Project Proposal

## Option 1: new computational tool: Peach Blossom Sketch

Peach Blossom Sketch is a fun animation tool for creating doodles that
come to life!

As a youngster, I was fond of creating animated GIFS using simple bitmap tools such as MS Paint. My plan is to return to this practice in collaboration with an illustrator/painter who is interested in animation.

"I like drawing and have wanted to try animation, but have felt
overwhelmed an intimidated by the prospect of jumping into new tools.
I'm looking forward to a fun and easy-to-use animation tool." -

## Right-sized Project Scope

* Onion skinning: Quickly doodle some noodles, flip to the next frame and see the previous frame as a semi-transparent reference layer

* Play animation or browse animation frames

* Simple erase tool

* Export grid of frames w/ cut-lines as PDFs to facilitate plotting (on the AxiDraw) and fabrication of an animation flip-book

## Implementation challenges

* creating and storing/retrieving animation frames as vectors

* integrating iPad tablet as an input source

* exporting animation frames to multiple PDFs for plotting with AxiDraw

## Design challenges

* create a lightweight UI that is simple, straightforward, while still supporting the needs of the animator

## Strategies for evaluation

* I want to facilitate an "aha" moment for users that don't have an animation practice. If newcomers to animation have a hard time getting started, then that is an orange flag

* Peach Blossom Luck will support exporting scaled-down frames to PDFs to facilitate plotting frames with cut-lines on the AxiDraw. The ease of this process will factor into my evaluation of the project's implementation
