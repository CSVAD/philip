  # Animation Example

  This example lets you create animation frames and play them back.

  ## Keyboard Controls
  There are a number of keyboard key bindings that showcase the features
  of the library:

  `e`: export frames to scaled-down-grid for plotting on the Axidraw
  with InkScape

  `r`: reset the system, clear all frames

  `d`: previous frame

  `f`: next frame

  `g`: new frame

  `p`: play/pause the animation

  `c`: copy the current frame contents

  `v`: paste the clipboard into the current frame

  `u`: simplified "undo." this command removes the last stroke from the
  current frame
