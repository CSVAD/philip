# Wallpaper

I arrived at my wallpaper by modifying the truchet code examples to introduce random noise in the generation of the tiles. I also added ellipses that had random attributes unrelated to the repetitive pattern of the wallpaper.

The decisions I made in my design had to do with what lines I wanted to draw to create my truchet tile pattern, and what kind of generative circles did I want to have dotting my tilescape.
